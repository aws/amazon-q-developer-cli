# Amazon Q for command line

This is the Amazon Q for command line IDE extension. It only supports completions in your IDEs' terminal emulator.

If you would like completions in your editor, please download the [AWS Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode) and set up Amazon Q.

For support, please see [github.com/aws/q-command-line-discussions](https://github.com/aws/q-command-line-discussions).
