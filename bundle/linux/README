# ðŸš€ Amazon Q CLI Installation on Linux

## 1. Installation

To install the Amazon Q CLI, run the following command:

```bash
./install.sh
```

If you only want to install the `q` CLI without `qterm` or modifying dotfiles, use the following command:

```bash
./install.sh --q-cli
```

## 2. SSH Configuration
If you are installing the Amazon Q CLI on a remote machine and want to enable SSH support, add the following lines to your SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):

```bash
AcceptEnv Q_SET_PARENT
AllowStreamLocalForwarding yes
```

After making these changes, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
