# TDD Prompts Audit for Amazon Q CLI Automatic Naming Feature

## Overview

This document evaluates the test-driven development (TDD) prompts in `tdd_prompts.md` against best practices for incremental development, early testing, and integration. The focus is on ensuring each prompt builds logically on previous work without introducing complexity jumps or leaving orphaned code.

## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Strong Test-First Approach**: Each implementation prompt is preceded by test creation, adhering to TDD principles.
2. **Phased Implementation**: The plan breaks down the feature into logical phases with increasing complexity.
3. **Clear Component Boundaries**: Each module has well-defined responsibilities and interfaces.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Emphasis on maintaining compatibility throughout the implementation.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Missing Mock Implementation**: No explicit creation of mock objects needed for testing.
2. **Integration Gaps**: Some components are developed in isolation without clear integration points.
3. **Dependency Management**: Dependencies between components aren't explicitly addressed in early prompts.
4. **Complexity Jumps**: Phase 2 introduces significant complexity with NLP libraries without intermediate steps.
5. **Missing CLI Command Registration**: No explicit step for registering the enhanced command with the CLI framework.
6. **Conversation Model Definition**: No clear definition of the `Conversation` struct that's used throughout.

## Recommended Changes

### 1. Add Conversation Model Definition

**Insert before Prompt 1:**
```
Create a Conversation model for testing the Amazon Q CLI automatic naming feature. Define:

1. A `Conversation` struct with:
   - Messages (user and assistant)
   - Metadata (timestamps, model used, etc.)
   - Any other relevant fields

2. Helper functions for:
   - Creating test conversations
   - Adding messages to conversations
   - Extracting conversation content

This model will be used throughout the implementation for testing and should match the structure used in the actual CLI.
```

### 2. Add Mock Creation Prompt

**Insert before Prompt 2:**
```
Create mock objects for testing the Amazon Q CLI automatic naming feature. Implement:

1. Mock conversations with various patterns:
   - Simple Q&A conversations
   - Technical discussions
   - Multi-topic conversations
   - Conversations with code blocks

2. Mock file system operations for testing save functionality:
   - File writing
   - Directory creation
   - Permission checking
   - Error simulation

3. Mock configuration system for testing save settings:
   - Configuration reading
   - Configuration writing
   - Default values

These mocks will be used throughout the test suite to ensure consistent and reliable testing.
```

### 3. Revise Prompt 4 (Save Configuration)

**Replace with:**
```
Implement the save_config.rs module for the Amazon Q CLI automatic naming feature. The implementation should:

1. Pass all the configuration-related tests created earlier
2. Provide functions to:
   - Get the default save path
   - Set the default save path
   - Check if a path exists and is writable
   - Create directories as needed

3. Include error handling for configuration issues
4. Support reading and writing configuration from/to a config file
5. Create a simple integration point with the existing CLI configuration system

Additionally, create a small integration test that verifies the save_config module can be used with the filename_generator module from the previous step.
```

### 4. Add CLI Command Registration Prompt

**Insert between Prompts 5 and 6:**
```
Implement the command registration for the enhanced save command. The implementation should:

1. Register the enhanced save command with the CLI framework
2. Handle command-line arguments parsing
3. Route the command to the appropriate handler
4. Provide help text for the command

This step ensures the enhanced save command is properly integrated with the CLI framework and can be invoked by users.
```

### 5. Break Down Phase 2 Complexity

**Replace Prompt 8 with two prompts:**

```
Implement basic NLP capabilities for the topic extractor. The implementation should:

1. Add simple NLP techniques to the existing topic_extractor.rs:
   - Basic tokenization
   - Stop word removal
   - Frequency analysis
   - Simple keyword extraction

2. Maintain the same API as the original implementation
3. Pass the first set of enhanced topic extraction tests
4. Include clear documentation on the NLP techniques used

This implementation should be a stepping stone toward the fully enhanced topic extractor.
```

```
Extend the topic extractor with advanced NLP capabilities. The implementation should:

1. Build on the basic NLP implementation
2. Add more sophisticated techniques:
   - Topic modeling
   - Conversation type classification
   - Specialized terminology handling

3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Pass all remaining enhanced topic extraction tests
5. Include performance optimizations

This implementation completes the enhanced topic extraction functionality.
```

### 6. Add Incremental Integration Steps

**Insert after each major component implementation:**
```
Create an integration checkpoint for the [component] implementation. This should:

1. Verify the component works with previously implemented components
2. Create a small example that uses all components implemented so far
3. Update any existing integration tests to include the new component
4. Document any integration issues or edge cases discovered

This checkpoint ensures no orphaned code exists and all components work together as expected.
```

### 7. Add Continuous Integration Prompt

**Insert before Final Integration:**
```
Implement continuous integration tests for the Amazon Q CLI automatic naming feature. The tests should:

1. Set up a CI pipeline configuration
2. Include all unit tests and integration tests
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing functionality
5. Check for security vulnerabilities

These tests ensure the feature can be safely integrated into the main codebase and deployed to users.
```

## Implementation Timeline Revision

The revised implementation timeline should follow this structure:

1. **Foundation (Prompts 1-3)**
   - Conversation model definition
   - Test framework setup
   - Mock creation
   - Filename generator implementation
   - Topic extractor basic implementation

2. **Core Integration (Prompts 4-7)**
   - Save configuration implementation
   - Save command enhancement
   - Command registration
   - Initial integration tests

3. **Enhanced Features (Prompts 8-12)**
   - Basic NLP capabilities
   - Advanced NLP capabilities
   - User configuration tests and implementation
   - Security tests and implementation

4. **Final Steps (Prompts 13-16)**
   - Documentation generation
   - Continuous integration
   - Final integration
   - Final testing and summary

## Conclusion

The TDD prompts provide a solid foundation for implementing the Amazon Q CLI automatic naming feature. With the recommended changes, the implementation plan will better adhere to best practices for incremental development, early testing, and proper integration. The revised plan ensures no complexity jumps or orphaned code, resulting in a more maintainable and robust implementation.

By addressing these recommendations, the development team can implement the feature more efficiently and with higher quality, leading to a better user experience and easier future maintenance.
