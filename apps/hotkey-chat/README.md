# Hotkey-chat Desktop App

This is an interactive chatbot that can be opened anywhere via `Option + Space`. You can input images as well as text. You need to enable Screen & System Audio Recording in order to allow the app to take screenshots of your displays. In order to instruct the chatbot to take screenshot, add `@screenshot` somewhere in your prompt.
