## üöÄ Start Contributing

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- Platform-specific dependencies (see setup)

### 1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli.git
```

### 2. Setup
Hassle-free setup:
```shell
npm run setup
```

Or if you'd like to DIY:

<details>
<summary>Manual Setup</summary>
<div>

### 1. Install platform dependencies

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```
### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> "${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc"
```

For bash:
```shell
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc"
```

For fish:
```shell
echo 'mise activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

</div>
</details>


### 3. Start Local Development

To build the project:
```shell
cargo build
```

To run the CLI:
```shell
cargo run --bin cli
```

To run specific commands (e.g., `q chat`):
```shell
cargo run --bin cli -- chat
```

> If you are working on other q commands, just append `-- <command name>`. For example, to run `q login`, you can run `cargo run --bin cli -- login`

To run tests for the CLI crate:
```shell
cargo test -p cli
```

To format Rust files:
```shell
cargo +nightly fmt
```

To run clippy:
```shell
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --color always -- -D warnings
```



### üí° Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- "What does this crate do?"

- "Where is X implemented?"

- "How do these components interact?"

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.




## üèóÔ∏è Project Layout

The project is organized as follows:

- [`cli`](crates/cli/) - The main `q` CLI implementation that allows users to interface with Amazon Q Developer from the command line
- AWS SDK Clients (in `crates/`):
  - `amzn-codewhisperer-client` - AWS CodeWhisperer service client
  - `amzn-codewhisperer-streaming-client` - Streaming client for CodeWhisperer
  - `amzn-consolas-client` - Client for Consolas service
  - `amzn-qdeveloper-streaming-client` - Streaming client for Q Developer
  - `amzn-toolkit-telemetry-client` - Telemetry client for AWS Toolkit
- [`scripts/`](scripts/) - Python scripts to build, sign, and test the project on macOS and Linux
- [`docs/`](docs/) - Project documentation
- [`proto/`](proto/) - Protocol buffer message specifications (if present)

The main CLI application (`crates/cli/`) includes:
- **API Client**: Handles communication with AWS services
- **Auth**: Authentication and authorization logic
- **Chat**: The interactive chat interface with tool integration
- **MCP Client**: Model Context Protocol client for extensibility
- **Platform**: Platform-specific implementations
- **Telemetry**: Usage tracking and analytics
