# âœ… TUI basic plan

Read the following files:
- crates/chat-exp/main.md - general idea of new architecture we are working on
- codebase/chat-exp/files-index.md - the list of some important files we are working with 
- crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env - current implementation of the new architecture

The goal now to plan the implementation of basic TUI for our agent loop.
After the task is completed, we need to query user for new prompt. And when the prompt is entered, we need to spawn new task, and so on.

Things to consider:
- this is when we need job/task lists cleanup in Session. I say keep up to 3 inactive jobs (completed or cancelled), remove them when new job is spawned
    - 3 must be a dedicated named constant
- There is a prompt implementation somewhere in the depth of crates/chat-cli/src/cli/chat/chat_session.rs
    - This file is 4K lines, only use sub-q to analyze it and ask questions about it.
    - i believe it's function `read_user_input()` on line 2909, but I could be wrong
    - you don't need to fully reproduce it, use it just as an example
- this time we need to hook into Ctrl+C key press:
    - when pressed in user prompt, it should abort the app
    - when pressed outside of user prompt (while a job is working) it should cancel the job
- since there's an 'await' for ChatArgs.execute, you need to find a way for `ui` (actual implementation under new folder crates/chat-cli/src/cli/chat/agent_env_ui) to await from ChatArgs.execute, and release that await when "abort the app" condition is met

Your task now is to define the implementation architecture that would cover that goal.
Write it down under planning/basic-tui/ (new folder)

# ðŸ”„ âœ… Documenting the design

Read the following files:
- crates/chat-exp/main.md - general idea of new architecture we are working on
- codebase/chat-exp/files-index.md - the list of some important files we are working with 
- crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env - current implementation of the new architecture

Your goals are:
- create documentation about the new architecture in folder `codebase/agent-environment`
    - explain the idea and moving pieces of the whole architecture
    - link those moving pieces to actual code (file+line numbers where applicable)
- update codebase/chat-exp/files-index.md with any extra file references that could be useful

# âœ… TUI Rework #1

Read the following files:
- codebase/agent-environment/README.md - documentation about the new architecture that we are working on (read linked files, and other files in that folder as needed)
- codebase/chat-exp/files-index.md - the list of some important files we are working with 
- crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env - current implementation of the new architecture
- planning/basic-tui/* - the plans for the next iteration

Focus on planning/basic-tui/02-user-input.md
The suggested design is a)goes in wrong direction and b)is significanl overkill for the first iteration.

I want you to re-work this design based on the following:
- transition from running task to prompting must be done with `continuation` mechanism
- promting process must end with either exist (`/quit`, the ONLY command we are going to support) OR launching a job with continuation set back to prompting process

The reason for that is that i want in the future to extend it to have two workers working in parallel at the same time. It would be impossible with the suggested `loop` design.

Note that it would also affect how we handle ctrl+c and graceful shutdown.

# âœ… Bring in Conversation State #1 - Assessment
Read the following files:
- codebase/agent-environment/README.md - documentation about the new architecture that we are working on (read linked files, and other files in that folder as needed)
- codebase/chat-cli/files-index.md - the list of some important files we are working with 
- crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env - current implementation of the new architecture

Your goal is to review original ChatSession implementation and how it was initialized in `ChatArgs.execute()`, focusing primarly on the conversation state.
You will have to check out a temporary copy of `crates/chat-cli/src/cli/chat/mod.rs` as it was on `main` branch. Save it to `codebase/chat-cli/temp/original_mode.rs`. The rest of the code around this package remains the same.

The main questions to answer are:
- How is conversation history maintained. Specifically operations of pushing in user's promts and agent's responses.
- What are classes implementing it?
- What's required to re-use the existing implementation? Can we simply do something like `let conversation = ConversationState::new(...)` and then toss around this instance?

Write your findings to
- codebase/chat-cli/convrsation-state-implementation.md - focused on current implementation
- codebase/chat-cli/convrsation-state-reuse.md - focused on re-use and ways to use (multiple) instances of conversation state in new architecture

# âœ… Bring in Conversation State #2 - Design
Read the following files:
- codebase/agent-environment/README.md - documentation about the new architecture that we are working on (read linked files, and other files in that folder as needed)
- codebase/chat-cli/files-index.md - the list of some important files we are working with 
- crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env - current implementation of the new architecture
- codebase/chat-cli/conversation-state-implementation.md - docs how the original design maintained conversation history
- codebase/chat-cli/conversation-state-reuse.md - recommendations on how that original history model could be reused

We are going to follow "Strategy 3: Conversation History Abstraction" - basically creating our own structs to maintain history, using existing [`HistoryEntry`](crates/chat-cli/src/cli/chat/conversation.rs#L92) as the 'backend' model

BUT, we are going to take a couple steps up in abstraction.

I want to add new field to `Worker` struct - `contextContainer`. Originally it will have single field `conversationHistory`, but with the goal to expand it more in the future.

For that conversationHistory we should be able to push entries to the history, similar to what's suggested in conversation-state-reuse.md strategy 3.

Major conceptual change is going to be that AgentLoop doesn't need to take prompt as the input anymore - it has to be pushed to the worker's conversation history before invoking the task:
```
worker.contextContainer.conversationHistory.push({userPrompt:"hello"});
session.run_agent_loop(worker, LoopInput{...nothing here...},...);
```

We are going to skip on database saving and other fancy stuff, just keep the conversation in memory.

Your goal is to create a design and then implementation plan for this change.
Write it to `planning/context-container-0/` folder


## Tweak 1
Make following changes:
- design.md
    - Worker class has been updated to use dyn ModelProvider instead of BedrockConverseStreamModelProvider
    - ConversationHistory.commit_turn should not fail if there's no next_user_message. Reason: for some specific tasks (orchestration-style, monitroing-style) there could be no user message at all
    - also replace "user_message" with "input_message". Reason: workers can be created and spawned by request from other workers rather than from the user
    - rename `crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env/context/` to `crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env/context_container` (would it introduce any namig collision problems though?)
- in `struct Worker`, `context_container` must be placed after name. This is the most critical piece of data that worker bears

Update other files accordingly.

## Tweak #2
Make following changes:
- design.md
    - `ConversationEntry`'s properties must be Optional, both of them
    - `ConversationHistory.next_input_message` is not needed
    - `ConversationHistory.push_input_message` must create an entry in `entries` with `user` value only
    - rename `ConversationHistory.commit_turn` to `ConversationHistory.push_assistant_message`. Make it also just add an entry in `entries`, but with `assistant` value only
    - Reasoning: we will hide all 'convert to original Q CLI Database Storage format and operations' under the hood, but implemented them later. Meanwhile both Codewhisperer and Bedrock APIs follow the same pattern of providing conversation history as a chain of alternating elements

# âœ… Prompt WorkerTask -> AgentEnvTextUi (TUI planning)

Read the following files:
- codebase/agent-environment/README.md - documentation about the new architecture that we are working on (read linked files, and other files in that folder as needed)
- codebase/chat-cli/files-index.md - the list of some important files we are working with 
- crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env - current implementation of the new architecture
- planning/basic-tui/* - the plans for the next iteration

Focus on planning/basic-tui/02-user-input.md
The suggested design defines prompt UI as a WorkerTask.

While I like the idea of "prompt is a task", I'm not fully sold on it.

Session's task/job management is supposed to focus on long-running autonomous processes that mutate Worker's state. "Prompt user" matches all except "autonomous" part.
Also, in the future I want to be able to replace TUI with web API OR even have them both up at the same time. Web API 'UI' won't need to keep up a job "ask user", as it's asynchronous by nature.

I've made a copy of the design docs in planning/basic-tui-as-a-task/ as a backup (this is still an interesting idea to research later)

I want you to re-work the main copy (planning/basic-tui/), specifically planning/basic-tui/02-user-input.md

- transition **from running task to prompting** must be done with `continuation` mechanism
- AgentEnv**Text**Ui will be responsible for handling those continuations, and maintain on-screen prompt active when necessary
- transition **from prompting to running task** must be done by AgentEnvTextUi launching new task when prompt process is complete

Important things to consider designing AgentEnvTextUi:
- on the next iteration we will spawn two workers at the app start. It means the prompt must be able to "queue" prompt processes somehow
    - For example, if prompt1 for worker1 is active, but worker2 completed, prompt2 for worker2 must NOT take over UI - user should be able to complete prompt1, and only after that it would show up prompt2
    - Bunus points if the prompt UI displays worker's ID and name
- AgentEnvTextUi must be able to share Session object with other *Ui's in the future
- Everything related to prompt maintenance, and jumping between prompt and loop task must be isolated in AgentEnvTextUi - Session must remain centered on the jobs and tasks tracking and management
- Same goes for handling extra commands. Right now we are going to support single command `/quit`, but in the future we will adopt all existing commands
- Prompt handler can simply push new request to Worker's ConversationState, and kick off AgentLoop task without parameters

In the end - **Session** maintains the state of jobs; **AgentEnvTextUi** maintains the state of user-facing UI.

## Tweak 1
Make the following adjustements:
- UI must NOT accept a worker or a list of workers, because new workers can be added to the session on the fly in the future
- has to account for workers being in the fly (with a job) at the time UI is `run()`
- entry point (`ChatArgs.execute()`) would create UI, create a worker, (maybe) start a job for the worker (using UI's continuation), and the do `ui.run()`
- in addition, ui should provide WorkerToHostInterface instances just like in the demo implementation. it will stream out the response to the screen

Also, just a question for now - what are the options to have TUI that would keep assistant answer printing to the screen, but also allow user to enter new prompt without messing things on the screen. i.e. all prints from WorkerToHostInterface.response_chunk_received would go 

## Tweak 2
Make the following changes:
- planning/basic-tui/05-complete-flow-example.md
    - `Main Entry Point` - check how current implementation uses `self.input`. Entry point should either start with continuation, like you suggested, OR launch a job with continuation, if input was provided
    - in `AgentEnvTextUi.run()` 
        - use `TextUiInterface` referenced below for `ui_interface`. Also rename this variable to `worker_host_ui`
    - in `impl WorkerToHostInterface for TextUiInterface`
        - rename `TextUiInterface` to `TextUiWorkerToHostInterface`
        - `worker_state_change` - add info-level logs "Worker {id} switched to state {new_state}"
        - where `stream_complete` is coming from and used for? it's not a part of current `WorkerToHostInterface`
            - Refer to crates/chat-cli/src/agent_env/worker_interface.rs

Update other files accordingly
