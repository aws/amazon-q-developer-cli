# Agent Environment Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the agent environment prototype from `crates/chat-exp/main.rs` into a production-ready structure under `crates/chat-cli/src/cli/chat/agent_env/`.

## Implementation Date

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Components (Production-Ready)
- `worker_job_continuations.rs` - Job completion callback system with latched state
- `model_provider.rs` - LLM communication trait abstraction
- `model_provider_impls/bedrock_converse_stream.rs` - Bedrock implementation
- `worker.rs` - Agent configuration with state management
- `worker_task.rs` - Interface for executable work units
- `worker_job.rs` - Running job combining worker, task, and execution
- `worker_interface.rs` - Communication contract between workers and UI
- `session.rs` - Central orchestrator for workers and jobs

### Demo Components (Temporary)
- `demo/proto_loop.rs` - Demo task showing complete agent flow
- `demo/cli_interface.rs` - Console-based UI implementation
- `demo/init.rs` - Demo-specific setup functions

### Integration
- `chat/mod.rs` - Added agent_env module and integrated with ChatArgs.execute()
- `Cargo.toml` - Added aws-sdk-bedrockruntime dependency

## Key Changes from Prototype

1. **Module Organization**: Split monolithic prototype into focused modules
2. **Naming**: Renamed `continuations` to `worker_job_continuations` for clarity
3. **Structure**: Created `model_provider_impls/` subdirectory for implementations
4. **Error Handling**: Replaced `anyhow::Error` with `eyre::Error` to match project conventions
5. **Async Closures**: Fixed lifetime issues with proper async closure patterns

## Build Status

✅ **SUCCESS** - Compiles with warnings only (unused imports, expected for demo integration)

Build completed in 16.49s with 541 warnings (mostly unused imports from existing code).

## Integration Point

The agent environment is now integrated into `ChatArgs.execute()` and demonstrates:
- Creating a session with AWS Bedrock model provider
- Building multiple workers
- Launching concurrent jobs with different prompts
- Adding completion continuations
- Cancellation after timeout
- Proper cleanup

## Next Steps

As outlined in the planning documents:

### Short Term
1. Replace `WorkerProtoLoop` with `MainAgentLoop`
2. Replace `CliInterface` with production UI
3. Add conversation history to Worker
4. Add tools provider to Worker

### Medium Term
1. Add context resources to Worker
2. Add request builder to Worker
3. Implement `/compact` as WorkerTask
4. Add orchestrator loop as WorkerTask

### Long Term
1. Replace demo initialization with production config
2. Add persistence for conversations
3. Add telemetry integration
4. Add error recovery mechanisms

## Testing

To test the implementation:
```bash
cargo run --bin chat_cli
```

This will run the demo with two concurrent workers making requests to AWS Bedrock.
